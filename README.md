## About From Left to Write Calligraphy

From Left to Write Calligraphy is a calligraphy blog that will eventually aim to provide content that will help both beginners and seasoned calligraphers alike. 

## Why create this site from scratch?

I will be developing this site as I go along my development journey starting off by creating a personal blog and hopefully transform it into full-fledged platform wherein people can sign-up and find learning content, or create a space for them to market their services to potential clients.
